## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

This was nasty for me. So much Javascript and it was quite overwhelming. I'm sure that it's highly unoptimised and ugly but it gets the job done, mostly!

### Continued development

Improve the JS. Make the drag and drop functionality better. Experiment with React.
